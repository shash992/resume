Projects

Asha IT Recruitment | AWS, Bedrock, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Firebase Auth | go.umd.edu/ashait

January 2025 – Present

• Developed a full-stack recruitment platform with a serverless backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway), Firebase

Authentication and a DynamoDB schema supporting multi-role access.

• Implemented Bedrock- and LangGraph-based candidate scoring and semantic retrieval, via Lambda microservices.
• Built secure file ingestion using presigned S3 workflows and event-driven resume parsing and data enrichment.

OpenCanvas | Neo4j, LangChain, FastMCP, Vector DBs, Agentic Systems | npm

June 2025
• Designed and built a graph-native AI workspace that allows multiple concurrent LLM contexts to reason over persistent

user knowledge graphs.

• Implemented hybrid retrieval pipelines combining Neo4j graph traversal with vector semantic search to improve factual

grounding and reduce hallucination.

• Built long-term memory and session-level context persistence enabling multi-turn reasoning across tasks, documents,

and conversations.
